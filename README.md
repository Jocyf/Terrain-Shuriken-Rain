Terrain Rain notes:
-------------------

Rain is a shuriken particle system with collision detection so it creates water splashes when colliding (there are two versions to look at).

Snow & clouds are shuriken particle systems too.

There is an basic FPS underwater system up & running with real time fullscreen deformation.

Note: The full terrain Assets from old Unity versions is included to.

I'm included the old FPS Controller from Unity 2.x
